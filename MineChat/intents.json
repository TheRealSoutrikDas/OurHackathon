It contains essential details, including the employee's name, age, gender, type of employment (whether above or below ground), date of employment commencement, and other prescribed particulars. The responsibility for maintaining this register lies with the mine's manager. Different registers are maintained for various types of mine work, such as below ground, open cast workings, and others. Some mines may receive exemptions from maintaining separate registers based on specific reasons determined by the Central Government. It's crucial to note that no one can be employed in a mine if their particulars aren't recorded in the register. To enter open cast or underground workings, individuals must obtain permission, and the recording of names below ground enhances safety and accountability. The register should be regularly updated to reflect any workforce changes."

For example, if a particular award or contract of service offers more extensive annual leave with wages than what's outlined in this Chapter , the mine worker is entitled to the leave specified in that agreement. However, the regulation of leave matters not covered in the agreement will be governed by Sections 50 to 56 in the mining regulations. These sections encompass a range of leave-related aspects, including earned leave, calculation methods, accumulation, and other leave-related concerns, ensuring comprehensive regulation of leave for mine workers.",
      "The primary purpose of Section 49 in mining regulations is to ensure that the rights and entitlements of individuals employed in mines are protected. It accomplishes this by preventing any deprivation of rights to which mine workers may be entitled under different laws or through agreements such as awards or contracts of service. Section 49 acts as a safeguard, preserving the existing rights of mine workers and making exceptions when necessary. For instance, if a specific award or contract of service provides for more extensive annual leave with wages than what is stipulated in VII Chapter, the mine worker is entitled to the leave mentioned in that agreement. However, the regulation of other leave-related matters not covered in the agreement falls under the jurisdiction of Sections 50 to 56 in the mining regulations. These sections encompass various facets of leave, including earned leave, calculation methods, accumulation, and other leave-related aspects, ensuring thorough oversight of leave for mine workers.",
      "Section 49 is fundamentally significant in the context of mine worker rights as it ensures that their rights and entitlements are not compromised by the provisions of  Chapter VII. It acts as a protective shield, preserving rights granted to mine workers under other laws, agreements, or awards. While exceptions are allowed in cases of more extensive annual leave with wages, this section maintains a balance by regulating other leave-related matters under Sections 50 to 56. This comprehensive approach guarantees that mine workers receive fair treatment and enjoy the rights they are entitled to.",
      "Section 49 provides exceptions to ensure the protection of mine worker rights, but these exceptions are not limitless. They are primarily related to annual leave with wages. Any other rights and entitlements of mine workers not covered by  Chapter VII, awards, agreements, or contracts of service are not impacted by these exceptions. Section 49 aims to strike a balance between preserving existing rights and regulating specific aspects of annual leave.",
      "Section 49 has a direct impact on the enforcement of annual leave standards in mines. It ensures that mine workers receive the benefit of more extensive annual leave with wages if specified in an award, agreement, or contract of service. However, for leave-related matters not covered in those agreements, Sections 50 to 56 come into play to regulate and enforce the standards.",
      "While Section 49 primarily addresses annual leave with wages, it doesn't restrict mine workers from claiming rights and entitlements for non-leave-related matters under other laws or agreements. This section specifically aims to protect existing rights and entitlements.",
      "Section 49 applies to all persons employed in mines, including contractors and subcontractors. It ensures that the rights and entitlements of all mine workers are protected, regardless of their specific roles or contractual arrangements.",
      "If mine workers believe that their rights under Section 49 have been violated, they can take legal actions and seek remedies as per the relevant mining regulations and labor laws. They may also seek assistance from labor authorities and legal counsel to address any grievances.",
      "The Central Government plays a significant role in implementing Section 49 by overseeing and ensuring compliance with mining regulations and labor laws. It provides the necessary guidance and support to enforce the rights and entitlements of mine workers.",
      "Section 49 generally applies prospectively to new agreements and awards. However, it may also impact existing agreements and awards to the extent that they provide more extensive annual leave with wages than what is outlined in  Chapter VII. In such cases, the mine workers are entitled to the leave specified in those agreements, while the regulation of other leave-related matters not covered in the agreements is governed by Sections 50 to 56.",
      "Employers who violate Section 49 may face penalties as per the relevant mining regulations and labor laws. These penalties are designed to ensure compliance and uphold the rights and entitlements of mine workers. Penalties may include fines, legal actions, and other remedies to rectify violations and protect the rights of mine workers."

      "Section 52 of mining regulations outlines the provision for 'Annual leave with wages' for mine workers. This means that every person employed in a mine who has completed a calendar year's service is entitled to a specific number of days of leave with wages. The calculation for this leave differs based on whether the person is employed below ground or in other capacities. For those below ground, it's one day for every fifteen days of work, while for others, it's one day for every twenty days of work. The completion of a calendar year's service is determined by the number of attendances at the mine, with specific criteria set for both categories of workers. There are exceptions to this calculation, such as days of lay-off, maternity leave, and leave earned in the previous year. These days count towards attendances but do not earn additional leave. Additionally, any leave not taken in a calendar year can be carried forward to the next year, up to a maximum of thirty days. Workers can apply for this leave, with a limit of three times in a calendar year. Refusal of leave is only permissible if deemed necessary due to the exigencies of the situation. It's important to note that if a mine worker wants to use this leave for illness, they are entitled to it even if the application is not submitted within the specified time. Payment for unused leave, in case of termination or death, is made promptly by the mine owner, agent, or manager, as specified in Section 53. The calculation of wages in lieu of unused leave is detailed in the respective section. This provision applies uniformly to all mine workers, without distinction between different categories of employment.",

The Central Government can approve bye-laws as published or with modifications after considering objections. Approved bye-laws must be posted in English and any other prescribed languages at or near the mine. They should be easily visible to mine personnel and renewed promptly if damaged. The Central Government has the authority to rescind or partially rescind any bye-law previously made. Bye-laws can be posted in English and any other languages as prescribed or required for effective communication with mine personnel.",
      "In the Mining Act, 'bye-laws' are rules made by mine owners, agents, or managers to keep miners safe and organized. If they don't make these rules or if the rules aren't good enough, government inspectors can help. If there's a disagreement, a special committee steps in to sort things out. These rules must then be approved by the government, taking public opinions into account. Once approved, they need to be posted at the mine in languages that everyone understands. The government can also change or cancel these rules if needed.",
      "Think of 'bye-laws' in the Mining Act as safety rules for mines. Mine owners, agents, or managers can make these rules, but they must be good enough. If not, government inspectors can suggest better ones. If there's a disagreement, a committee can settle it. These rules need government approval, and people can share their thoughts before approval. Once okayed, they must be put up at the mine in languages everyone knows. The government can also change or cancel these rules.",
      "In the Mining Act, 'bye-laws' are like house rules for mines. Mine bosses can create these rules to make sure everyone stays safe and follows the law. But if these rules aren't up to scratch, government inspectors can step in and help. If there's an argument about the rules, a special committee can jump in to sort things out. Once everyone agrees, these rules get a thumbs-up from the government. They need to be put up at the mine so everyone can see them, and the government can change or even get rid of these rules if they need to."
